# Workshop: Human-like visual search application with small data
A workshop on how to build and deploy human-like visual search application with Siamese Mask R-CNN

Audience level: Beginner - Intermediate 

## Abstract 

_Task_: Prototype a visual search application with human-like flexibility

_Limitations_: Unaffordable price for large annotated datasets, small and limited data, computational resources

_Solution_: One-shot instance segmentation with Siamese Mask R-CNN

During the workshop we cover the building blocks of Siamese Mask R-CNN model and showcase its ability to detect and segment objects from novel categories based on a single reference image. Next, we try a single deployment. Lastly, we discuss possible limitations and improvements. At the end of the workshop, participants will have a basic understanding on how to prototype and deploy human-like visual search applications.

### Requirements:  
- TensorFlow, Keras, TBA
